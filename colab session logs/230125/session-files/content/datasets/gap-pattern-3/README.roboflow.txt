The dataset includes 948 images.
Charts are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -2 and +2 degrees
* Random shear of between -1째 to +1째 horizontally and -1째 to +1째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.22 percent of pixels
